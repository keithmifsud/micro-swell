#Micro-swell
A simple Php framework for Application container, Dependency Injection and Http requirements.

Basically, the application layer for Php projects.

##This package is initial stages of development
Not much is useful to anyone just yet except for if you wish to see how such a framework can be put together.

##Purpose
The purpose of micro-swell is to satisfy my personal requirements to have a really non-intrusive and a really not opinionated framework that I can use as I please in different projects with varying architecture and structure.

##Roadmap
I am aiming to have an initial release with just the basic requirements and tests
[as per milestone](https://github.com/swellphp/micro-swell/milestones/Initial%20Release%20of%20Swell%20Microframework)

I intend to add more features, components and wrappers afterwards depending on my project's requirements and possibly your ideas :)

These will most probably be add-ons and not necessarily a part of the micro-swell framework.
